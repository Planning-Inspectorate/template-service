// NOTES
//
// use '//' comments for notes relevant to the schema
// use '///' comments for notes that should be included in the types definition
// see https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema#comments
//
// we use GUIDs for IDs (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/uniqueidentifier-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)
// this is because these IDs may be used in URLs and it makes them harder to guess
// while we don't rely on that for security, it adds an extra layer
// not everything needs this, but easier to make them all consistent and the increase in size (vs int) is negligible

// TODO: add models here!
